Subject: README.md – Credit Card Customer Clustering

# 💳 Credit Card Customer Clustering

## 📌 Project Description

This project performs **Customer Segmentation using Clustering techniques** on **Credit Card customer data**.
The goal is to group customers based on their spending behavior and usage patterns to better understand different customer segments.

This project is implemented as a **mini project** to gain hands-on experience with **unsupervised machine learning** and data analysis.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Selvaganapathy-k/CREDIT-CARD-CLUSTERING-
cd CREDIT-CARD-CLUSTERING-
```

---

### 2️⃣ (Optional) Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the environment:

**Windows**

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Linux / macOS**

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

### 3️⃣ Install Required Libraries

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 4️⃣ Run the Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open:

```
dataset.ipynb
```

## 🔍 Analysis Performed

* Data loading and inspection
* Handling missing values
* Feature scaling and preprocessing
* Applying clustering algorithms
* Visualizing customer segments
* Interpreting cluster characteristics

---

## 📈 Key Insights

* Customers can be grouped into distinct clusters based on spending behavior
* Some clusters represent high-value customers with frequent usage
* Other clusters indicate low-spending or inactive customers

---

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

* Understanding of **unsupervised learning**
* Practical knowledge of clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means)
* Data preprocessing and feature scaling
* Visualization and interpretation of clusters
* Structuring data science projects on GitHub

---

## 📌 Notes

* Virtual environment folders (`venv`, `myvenv`) are not included in the repository.
* All required dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.
